# Copyright-protection-semi-blind-watermaking

This project uses a semi-blind watermarking approach to prove ownership of the image.

## Features

-> The aim of this case study is to demonstrate a digital watermarking scheme using visual cryptography for copyright protection of a digital image. 

-> Based on the security property of visual cryptography, the two shares on their own cannot leak any information about the watermark. 

-> The experimental results show that even after the image was modified, the invisible watermark was successfully extracted from it.
